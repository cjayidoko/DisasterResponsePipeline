## Installation: 
The codes .py and .ipynb files in this repository run on an anaconda installed Python environment.

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is develop a supervised predictive model that can classify text messages recievdd during a disaster into the different categories of disasters following the different categpries seen in the dataset. Further, the project also include bulding an application that will apply the machine-learning model to any new text data and bring out clean visualization of the data. Natural Language Took-kits are used in the developemnt of the machine-learning model

## File Descriptions:
The dataset utilized for this study are obtained from Figure 8, and provided to Udacity, and thus not publicly available. The datasets include the messages.csv data nd the categries.csv. The message.csv data contains columns: message (raw message recieved during disaster), the message id, the genre (whether it is social media, news, or direct text messages), and the categories. The categories.csv contain the id and the different categories the message belongs to. Some of the categories include: medical related, search and rescue, request help, millitary, etc.

## Results: 
The findings of this study are in the repository and yet to be published
